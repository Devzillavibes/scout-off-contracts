//! CPU-instruction cost regression budget for the progress contract.
//!
//! Measures the CPU-instruction cost of representative progress operations
//! using soroban-sdk's test budget utilities (`Env::cost_estimate`) and
//! asserts each stays within a checked-in per-operation budget. See
//! `ci/cpu-cost-budget.md` for the full cross-contract budget table and the
//! process for raising a budget when a legitimate feature grows an
//! operation's cost.
//!
//! To raise a budget: bump the relevant constant below AND update the
//! matching row in `ci/cpu-cost-budget.md` with a one-line justification in
//! the PR description explaining why the growth is expected and acceptable.
//!
//! These tests do not wire a registration contract (`set_registration_contract`
//! is intentionally left unset), so the measured cost reflects the progress
//! contract's own work only, not the cross-contract sync path — that path is
//! covered by the dedicated registration<->progress integration test instead.
